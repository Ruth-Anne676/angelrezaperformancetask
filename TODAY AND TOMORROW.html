<h1>What is Covid-19?</h1>
<p align="left">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</p>
<h1>Preventive Measures</h1>

<br>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</br>
<br>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</br>
<br>Avoid touching your face.</br>
<br>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</br>
<br>Stay home if you feel unwell.</br>
<br>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</br>
<br>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</br>
